Objective-C FizzBuzz Kata
=========================

This Kata is a classic! Use the provided FizzBuzzTests class to call the FizzBuzz "answer" method. Start by adding a test that fails and then add just enough implementation to make the test pass. Keep going until your confident you have a working implementation.

Rules
-----
Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizzbuzz. All other numbers return their string equivalent. Here's what it looks like:

    [fizzBuzz answer:1] should return @"1"
    [fizzBuzz answer:2] should return @"2"
    [fizzBuzz answer:3] should return @"fizz"
    [fizzBuzz answer:4] should return @"4"
    [fizzBuzz answer:5] should return @"buzz"
    [fizzBuzz answer:6] should return @"fizz"
    ...
    [fizzBuzz answer:15] should return @"fizzbuzz"
